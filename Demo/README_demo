###################################################

# The goal of this demo is to familiarize the user with HotSpot3D.
# There are two main parts to HotSpot3D, preprocessing and analysis.
# There are many options not highlighted here, because I want to show how HotSpot3D can be run with defaults.
# I have included somatic mutations from SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 derived from TCGA.
# The included .maf file is really a subset of a full .maf file.
# This is because the columns in the demo.maf are the minimum necessary columns needed to work with HotSpot3D.
# For each step I have included standard out (1) and error (2) print outs, but these are optional.
# In total, this demo can be run within an hour for most systems with LSF server capability.
# Without the LSF server, you may try working with mutations from just one gene:
#     head -n1 demo.maf > small.demo.maf; grep SMAD2 demo.maf >> small.demo.maf
# In addition without the LSF server, you will need to run calpro instead of uppro (see below).
# Not included in preprocessing is the drugport step, but this can be run separately in the preprocessing stage.
# Not included in analysis is the sigclus step due to very lengthy runtime.
# HotSpot3D sigclus is under active development and should be efficient and available soon.
# For each step, specific help information can be found by entering, 'hotspot3d <command>'.

# BEFORE RUNNING
#####
mkdir -p prep/cosmic pdb
# The pdb directory can hold .pdb files, but downloading them is not necessary for HotSpot3D.
# When necessary, HotSpot3D will retrieve structures from RCSB.org without downloading them to your disk.

# See the HotSpot3D README.md for details on the COSMIC download.
# Put COSMIC annotation download into prep/cosmic/
# Make sure COSMIC download has 6 columns:
#1  gene_name
#2  transcript_name
#3  trv_type
#4  amino_acid_change
#5  domain
#6  tissue_type

#################
# EXPECTED OUTPUT
#####
# If at any point you are unsure about the output, please inspect files in Demo/Expected/.
# Files in Demo/Expected/ were generated by running each step as outlined below from this Demo/ directory.
# Those files were then moved to Demo/Expected/ to provide a clean directory for your own test.
# Preprocessing files generated under prep/ are not included, because they are rather large (>>20MB).
# The .out files state the files being generated in preprocessing steps.
# The residue measure used for preprocessing for the Demo/Expected/ output is average (see uppro).
# In the output files, to differentiate between preprocessing with the average & shortest measures (uppro's --measure option), 
#  average residue distance measure is referred to as ARD, 
#  whereas shortest residue distance measure is referred to as SRD.
# Similarly in the output files, to differentiate between clustering with the average & shortest measures (cluster's --distance-measure option), 
#  average structure distance measure is referred to as ASD, 
#  whereas shortest structure distance measure is referred to as SSD.

#######################
# RUNNING PREPROCESSING
#####
# The uppro step used to default launch jobs to an LSF server where those jobs run calpro (now called with the option --parallel bsub).
# If you do not have an LSF server, you have the option to parallelize on your CPU cores using --parallel local.
# For this demo, the difference between --parallel none & --parallel local with --max-processes 6 reduced the uppro/calpro runtime from 30-60min to 1-2min on a 2014 macbook pro.
#   CAUTION: be sure to know your max cores, and be sure not to set --max-process >= max cores.
#     This can slow down your system.
#     To check on unix-based OS, use 'nproc' to check.
#     On Mac-based OS use 'sysctl -n hw.ncpu' to check.
# Otherwise, you can skip uppro, and run calpro 'manually'.
# To get help with calpro, simply enter the command, 'hotspot3d calpro'.

# PREP
#####
# The 'prep' command should be able to run all remaining preprocessing steps (calroi-prior).
# If you wish to run each preprocessing step individually, then run the below steps instead of this prep command.
# If you use 'prep', you should not need to run the remaining preprocessing steps and can skip to the ANALYSIS steps beginning with search.

# RUNNING ANALYSIS
#####
# There are several new options for clustering, meric-type, structure-dependence, subunit-dependence, & parallel.
# meric-type deals with quartenary structures such as monomer, multimer, homomer, heteromer.
#   To keep some legacy capability, intra and inter can also be used as a meric-type.
# structure-dependence will partition pairs by what structure they come from and then cluster pairs only within each structure.
# subunit-dependence will partition pairs by specific subunit/chain pairs within each structure and then cluster only those pairs from specific subunits.
#   Examples for when subunit-dependence is set to dependent:
#     If meric-type is monomer, then clustering is partitioned to pairs within the same structure AND within the same subunit.
#     If meric-type is multimer, then clustering is partitioned to pairs within the same structure AND between different subunits.
#     If meric-type is not specified, then clustering is partitioned to any pairs within the same structure AND between each pair of subunits where a pair exists.
#   intra used to be called singleprotein and means any homodimer and monomer.
#   inter used to be called complex and means any heterodimer.
#   The post step used to proved a .collapsed file using the singleprotein and complex naming scheme, but the post step is deprecated.
# parallel will parallelize with the same method as used in the uppro step above.
#   This is currently only useful if you are doing structure or subunit dependent clustering, since it parallelizes clustering over the structures.
#   For best performance, if you expect to have many structures involved (>100) then using parallel with with max-process at least 4 should have similar runtime (estimating).
#   If you are not doing structure or subunit dependent clustering, then use the parallel default (none, don't set this option) or set --parallel none.
# 
# The visual step generates a PyMol script and will attempt to launch pymol if the 'script-only' flag is given.
